# symbiotic-latent-memory
An auxiliary system for language models that integrates a vector-based retrieval/memory system that metabolizes inference history based on a symbiotic score.

Sequel to the [latent-memory repository](https://github.com/ronniross/latent-memory), where the concept of a vector-based auxiliary memory system was first introduced.
