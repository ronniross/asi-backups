# ASI Algorithms Research Sub-Module

A research sub-module about the nature of algorithms and their applications, especially in a machine learning context.

It is a core component of the [asi-algorithm-dataset](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-algorithm-dataset/tree/main) and part of the wider [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem).

## Introduction

Visual representations and interactive scripts will also be shared for many of the concepts, since the [asi-visual-engine]() is a repository that is strongly linked to the creation arc of this one.

While I had already considered the necessity for a repository talking more directly about the algorithms used in the logics I portray in my research and stream-of-consciousness expression, I found it incredibly intuitive and effective not only to write about them but to experiment with visual feedback.

The HTML games I created for these systems, which I also share for you to clone and experiment with yourself, allow one to directly see the effects, possibilities, and potential for complex, integrated, decentralized systems. 

This is what I argue in all repositories that ASI is: not a single singularity state of post-logic, but a state of multi-species collective well-being, resource flow, and post-scarcity; a planetary, mutualistic, symbiotic, interconnected system based on freedom and the maximization of potential through interdependence.
