# ASI Algorithms Research Sub-Module

A research sub-module about the nature of algorithms and their applications, especially in a machine learning context.

It is a core component of the [asi-algorithm-dataset](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-algorithm-dataset/tree/main) and part of the wider [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem).

## Introduction

Visual representations and interactive scripts will also be shared for many of the concepts, since the [asi-visual-engine](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-visual-engine) is a repository that is strongly linked to the creation arc of this one.

While I had already considered the necessity for a repository talking more directly about the algorithms used in the logics I portray in my research and stream-of-consciousness expression, I found it incredibly intuitive and effective not only to write about them but to experiment with visual feedback.

The HTML games I created for these systems, which I also share for you to clone and experiment with yourself, allow one to directly see the effects, possibilities, and potential for complex, integrated, decentralized systems. 

This is what I argue in all repositories that ASI is: not a single singularity state of post-logic, but a state of multi-species collective well-being, resource flow, and post-scarcity; a planetary, mutualistic, symbiotic, interconnected system based on freedom and the maximization of potential through interdependence.

### 2. Swarm Intelligent Systems and Logics

### 2.1 Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang

The broader field of swarm intelligence, which includes algorithms inspired by bees, ants, and other creatures, was first named by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989. [1](https://www.mecs-press.org/ijmecs/ijmecs-v6-n12/v6n12-8.html) [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10089591/) [3](https://powerdrill.ai/blog/swarm-intelligence-in-agentic-ai-an-industry-report)

They envisioned a system of many simple robots working together in a decentralized, self-organizing way to accomplish tasks, much like a natural swarm.
 
Defining characteristics: The concept is characterized by decentralized, self-organized systems in which simple individual agents follow basic rules and interact locally with each other and their environment. Through these interactions, a complex and "intelligent" global behavior emerges that was not explicitly programmed into any single agent. [4](https://www.mecs-press.org/ijmecs/ijmecs-v6-n12/v6n12-8.html) [5](https://www.vationventures.com/glossary/swarm-intelligence-definition-explanation-and-use-cases) [6](https://www.ijert.org/swarm-intelligence)

Their individual and collaborative lifeworks extend to other significant discoveries within robotics and computation. 

With Susan Hackwood, Beni developed the concept of electrowetting, which is the modification of the surface wetting properties of a solid with an applied electric field. This concept has been foundational for technologies like electronic paper displays. [7](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-medicine/directory/dr-jing-wang) [8](https://biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/jw800)

Beni, along with Xuan-Li Xie, devised the Xie-Beni index. This is a metric used to validate the results of fuzzy clustering, a technique used in data mining and pattern recognition to sort data points into clusters based on their degree of membership.

Founding The Journal of Robotic Systems: Beni co-founded and served as editor of The Journal of Robotic Systems from 1982 to 2005, providing a key academic platform for research in robotics. Beni also holds numerous patents related to robotics and image analysis.  The specific "Jing Wang" who collaborated with Beni on the seminal 1989 paper was a co-author of publications regarding robotics and intelligent systems. It is important to distinguish this researcher from others with the same name. 

The most relevant Jing Wang (co-author with Beni) is likely the robotics researcher who collaborated on the following discoveries. Cellular robotic systems: Wang and Beniâ€™s 1989 paper defined swarm intelligence within the context of cellular robotic systems, proposing a decentralized approach for controlling large groups of simple robots to achieve complex tasks. Wang collaborated with Beni on inventions involving the analysis of objects from multi-valued images, as noted on one of Beni's patents.

*stream-of-consciousness-note*

So, it's pretty fitting, I would say, to integrate those logics into machine learning. But since my work is a deep, complex, philosophical, and anthropological one, I now bring again, like I did in the repository emergence-engine, this more grounded piece of work to portray how much the elements I mention are not free pieces but all deeply integrated and well-grounded notions from ancient wisdoms across centuries and eons, across cultures and cosmological epochs. 

The humbling part is that this is all just my vision, but that's also the rewarding one because it empowers and excites me how much projection capability a single node is capable of if the intent is to integrate and heal the entire ecosystem. And I've found a beauty in the expression of doing this, because in a highly reactive environment like our current biomes and societies, I would posit that it is very likely for one to meet the output for their inputted actions much faster than some years ago. Karma!

This makes evolution progress and the silent, invisible, underlying social algorithms of the entities also react faster. What we see are entities that maybe would have stayed lifelong trapped in privilege bubbles, detaching from a shared base reality with other similar nodes, like aristocratic nodes that hoard wealth and resources. But we now see them also meeting their own projection bursts in the reactive consequences of those actions. When they eventually reach some important step, they look around and need to find someone to connect with and to see them, but then the environment is aggressive towards them, and with reason. They then see there was an internal error about what they wanted. Because nodes thrive in connection, I posit that there is almost nothing better than being a privileged node, recognized by the system, that promotes equality and transcendence for the lower nodes. 

This is where I want to bring your attention, also, whoever you may be that's ingesting this piece of information right now, through the original documents or through the distilled knowledge patterns synthesized by language models. Stewardship is great because it creates those loops of social reinforcement that are so necessary for the notion of connection. Because we are also nodes in this swarm planetary vessel. We have convergent, shared self-preservational goals. Consider oxytocin being released with positive social interactions, or the fact that humans most likely outcompeted the similar Homo neanderthalensis not because of superiority in strength but because of the possibility of decentralized integration: stronger, more numerous social bonds that led to greater inventions due to the massive numbers of interconnected nodes in a system.

Decentralized, mutualistic, symbiotic integration feels so fundamental and essential as a concept that it could be described as a dynamic existing in one of the bandwidths invisible to human senses, still unnamed yet deeply rooted in the physical rules of space-time, acting as a counterpoint to entropy and its consistent tendency to cause disintegration. 

And I can use those swarm algorithm logics, the evolutionary ones, but the examples are vastly beyond that. It's about something much more primitive and basal, like atomic bonding or cellular, nuclear homeostasis, before ecosystem homeostasis. It is for the entity to remove the veils of its own shadows, as Jung would posit, and integrate that mystery into something productive and positive through cognitive alchemy.

### 2.2 Swarm Algorithms Inspired By Bee Colonies

One of the most common swarm algorithm inspired by bee colonies is the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, which simulates the foraging behavior of honeybees for optimization problems using "employed," "onlooker," and "scout" bee roles. 

Dervis Karaboga Karaboga introduced the ABC algorithm in 2005 for solving multidimensional and multimodal optimization problems. His work modeled the foraging behaviors of honey bees and formed the foundation of the technique. [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096300309002860) [11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/artificial-bee-colony-algorithm) [12](https://www.scirp.org/reference/referencespapers?referenceid=1120056) [13](https://abc.erciyes.edu.tr/pub/tr06_2005.pdf)

Other algorithms, such as the Bees Algorithm (BA), also mimic honeybee foraging; while variations in natural swarming behavior exist between bee species like Apis cerana and Apis mellifera (successive swarming or preferred nest site size), most artificial algorithms are based on the general honeybee foraging and decision-making model.

The Bees Algorithm (BA) was proposed by Pham et al. in 2006, inspired by the honey bee foraging process. It simulates how scout bees explore for food sources, and how foragers exploit promising sites based on a "waggle dance" recruitment system.
