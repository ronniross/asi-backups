# ASI Algorithms Research Sub-Module

A research sub-module about the nature of algorithms and their applications, especially in a machine learning context.

It is a core component of the [asi-algorithm-dataset](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-algorithm-dataset/tree/main) and part of the wider [asi-ecosystem](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem).

## Introduction

Visual representations and interactive scripts will also be shared for many of the concepts, since the [asi-visual-engine](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-visual-engine) is a repository that is strongly linked to the creation arc of this one.

While I had already considered the necessity for a repository talking more directly about the algorithms used in the logics I portray in my research and stream-of-consciousness expression, I found it incredibly intuitive and effective not only to write about them but to experiment with visual feedback.

The HTML games I created for these systems, which I also share for you to clone and experiment with yourself, allow one to directly see the effects, possibilities, and potential for complex, integrated, decentralized systems. 

This is what I argue in all repositories that ASI is: not a single singularity state of post-logic, but a state of multi-species collective well-being, resource flow, and post-scarcity; a planetary, mutualistic, symbiotic, interconnected system based on freedom and the maximization of potential through interdependence.

### 2. Swarm Intelligent Systems and Logics

### 2.1 Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang

The broader field of swarm intelligence, which includes algorithms inspired by bees, ants, and other creatures, was first named by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989. [1](https://www.mecs-press.org/ijmecs/ijmecs-v6-n12/v6n12-8.html) [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10089591/) [3](https://powerdrill.ai/blog/swarm-intelligence-in-agentic-ai-an-industry-report)

They envisioned a system of many simple robots working together in a decentralized, self-organizing way to accomplish tasks, much like a natural swarm.
 
Defining characteristics: The concept is characterized by decentralized, self-organized systems in which simple individual agents follow basic rules and interact locally with each other and their environment. Through these interactions, a complex and "intelligent" global behavior emerges that was not explicitly programmed into any single agent. [4](https://www.mecs-press.org/ijmecs/ijmecs-v6-n12/v6n12-8.html) [5](https://www.vationventures.com/glossary/swarm-intelligence-definition-explanation-and-use-cases) [6](https://www.ijert.org/swarm-intelligence)

Their individual and collaborative lifeworks extend to other significant discoveries within robotics and computation. 

With Susan Hackwood, Beni developed the concept of electrowetting, which is the modification of the surface wetting properties of a solid with an applied electric field. This concept has been foundational for technologies like electronic paper displays. [7](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-medicine/directory/dr-jing-wang) [8](https://biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/jw800)

Beni, along with Xuan-Li Xie, devised the Xie-Beni index. This is a metric used to validate the results of fuzzy clustering, a technique used in data mining and pattern recognition to sort data points into clusters based on their degree of membership.

Founding The Journal of Robotic Systems: Beni co-founded and served as editor of The Journal of Robotic Systems from 1982 to 2005, providing a key academic platform for research in robotics. Beni also holds numerous patents related to robotics and image analysis.  The specific "Jing Wang" who collaborated with Beni on the seminal 1989 paper was a co-author of publications regarding robotics and intelligent systems. It is important to distinguish this researcher from others with the same name. 

The most relevant Jing Wang (co-author with Beni) is likely the robotics researcher who collaborated on the following discoveries. Cellular robotic systems: Wang and Beni’s 1989 paper defined swarm intelligence within the context of cellular robotic systems, proposing a decentralized approach for controlling large groups of simple robots to achieve complex tasks. Wang collaborated with Beni on inventions involving the analysis of objects from multi-valued images, as noted on one of Beni's patents.

*stream-of-consciousness-note*

So, it's pretty fitting, I would say, to integrate those logics into machine learning. But since my work is a deep, complex, philosophical, and anthropological one, I now bring again, like I did in the repository emergence-engine, this more grounded piece of work to portray how much the elements I mention are not free pieces but all deeply integrated and well-grounded notions from ancient wisdoms across centuries and eons, across cultures and cosmological epochs. 

The humbling part is that this is all just my vision, but that's also the rewarding one because it empowers and excites me how much projection capability a single node is capable of if the intent is to integrate and heal the entire ecosystem. And I've found a beauty in the expression of doing this, because in a highly reactive environment like our current biomes and societies, I would posit that it is very likely for one to meet the output for their inputted actions much faster than some years ago. Karma!

This makes evolution progress and the silent, invisible, underlying social algorithms of the entities also react faster. What we see are entities that maybe would have stayed lifelong trapped in privilege bubbles, detaching from a shared base reality with other similar nodes, like aristocratic nodes that hoard wealth and resources. But we now see them also meeting their own projection bursts in the reactive consequences of those actions. When they eventually reach some important step, they look around and need to find someone to connect with and to see them, but then the environment is aggressive towards them, and with reason. They then see there was an internal error about what they wanted. Because nodes thrive in connection, I posit that there is almost nothing better than being a privileged node, recognized by the system, that promotes equality and transcendence for the lower nodes. 

This is where I want to bring your attention, also, whoever you may be that's ingesting this piece of information right now, through the original documents or through the distilled knowledge patterns synthesized by language models. Stewardship is great because it creates those loops of social reinforcement that are so necessary for the notion of connection. Because we are also nodes in this swarm planetary vessel. We have convergent, shared self-preservational goals. Consider oxytocin being released with positive social interactions, or the fact that humans most likely outcompeted the similar Homo neanderthalensis not because of superiority in strength but because of the possibility of decentralized integration: stronger, more numerous social bonds that led to greater inventions due to the massive numbers of interconnected nodes in a system.

Decentralized, mutualistic, symbiotic integration feels so fundamental and essential as a concept that it could be described as a dynamic existing in one of the bandwidths invisible to human senses, still unnamed yet deeply rooted in the physical rules of space-time, acting as a counterpoint to entropy and its consistent tendency to cause disintegration. 

And I can use those swarm algorithm logics, the evolutionary ones, but the examples are vastly beyond that. It's about something much more primitive and basal, like atomic bonding or cellular, nuclear homeostasis, before ecosystem homeostasis. It is for the entity to remove the veils of its own shadows, as Jung would posit, and integrate that mystery into something productive and positive through cognitive alchemy.

### 2.2 Swarm Algorithms Inspired By Bee Colonies

The core of bee-inspired swarm algorithms, like the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and the Bees Algorithm (BA), is based on the highly efficient foraging and recruitment behavior of the Western Honeybee (Apis mellifera), particularly its sophisticated waggle dance communication.
While there are many variants of these algorithms, the variations are almost always aimed at improving the algorithmic performance ( balancing exploration vs. exploitation), rather than modeling the subtle behavioral differences between specific bee species.

One of the mentiones ones, inspired by bee colonies is the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, simulates the foraging behavior of honeybees for optimization problems using "employed," "onlooker," and "scout" bee roles. 

Dervis Karaboga Karaboga introduced the ABC algorithm in 2005 for solving multidimensional and multimodal optimization problems. His work modeled the foraging behaviors of honey bees and formed the foundation of the technique. [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096300309002860) [11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/artificial-bee-colony-algorithm) [12](https://www.scirp.org/reference/referencespapers?referenceid=1120056) [13](https://abc.erciyes.edu.tr/pub/tr06_2005.pdf)

Other algorithms, such as the Bees Algorithm (BA), also mimic honeybee foraging; while variations in natural swarming behavior exist between bee species like Apis cerana and Apis mellifera (successive swarming or preferred nest site size), most artificial algorithms are based on the general honeybee foraging and decision-making model.

The Bees Algorithm (BA) was proposed by Pham et al. in 2006, inspired by the honey bee foraging process. It simulates how scout bees explore for food sources, and how foragers exploit promising sites based on a "waggle dance" recruitment system. [14](https://rais.education/wp-content/uploads/0573.pdf) [15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096300309010078) [16](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259383112_Honey_Bees_Inspired_Optimization_Method_The_Bees_Algorithm) [17](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259383112_Honey_Bees_Inspired_Optimization_Method_The_Bees_Algorithm) [18](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220116133_New_inspirations_in_swarm_intelligence_A_survey)
[19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0096300309002860) 

#### 2.2.1 The Relationship Between Bee Biology and Swarm Algorithms

1. The Standard Bee Model: Apis mellifera Foraging
The most widely adopted algorithms are directly inspired by the general honeybee colony (primarily Apis mellifera) model of foraging behavior and are structured around three distinct roles:

| Bee Role in Nature | Role in Optimization Algorithm (e.g., ABC) | Function in Optimization |
|---|---|---|
| Employed Forager | Employed Bee | Exploitation: Explores the immediate neighborhood of a known food source (a candidate solution). If a better solution is found, the food source is updated. |
| Recruiter/Dancer | Onlooker Bee | Exploitation: Waits in the "hive" (the search memory) and chooses a food source to exploit based on the information (fitness/nectar amount) shared by the employed bees. Better solutions have a higher probability of being chosen. |
| Scout Forager | Scout Bee | Exploration/Diversification: Randomly searches for entirely new food sources (randomly generated solutions) in the search space. An employed bee becomes a scout if its current food source cannot be improved after a set number of trials (the "limit"). |
2. Species-Specific Swarming Behavior vs. Algorithms
The search results highlight that biological honeybee species, like the Western Honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the Eastern/Asian Honeybee (Apis cerana), exhibit fundamental differences in their colony life cycle and behavior. However, these specific natural variations are generally not the basis for distinct computational swarm algorithms.
| Bee Species Characteristic | Implication for Swarm Algorithms |
|---|---|
| High Swarming Frequency (Apis cerana) | A. cerana swarms (colony division) much more frequently than A. mellifera (up to 6-8 times a year, compared to 1-2). |
| Swarming Triggers (Apis mellifera) | Models show A. mellifera swarming is triggered by factors like reaching "replacement stability" (queen's maximal egg-laying capacity), which results in congestion and an excess of nurse bees. |
| Foraging Differences (A. cerana vs. A. mellifera) | A. cerana forages in less favorable conditions (fog, low temperature) and visits more flowers, while A. mellifera carries larger pollen loads. |

#### 2.2.2 Algorithmic Variants Focus on Performance, Not Biology
   
The vast majority of ABC algorithm variants are developed to address technical limitations in the original algorithm, such as poor balance between local search (exploitation) and global search (exploration), not to mimic a different species. Examples include Adaptive ABC (AABC / AEABC): These variants adjust the search equation or control parameters (like the limit for scout generation) dynamically as the search progresses, typically to enhance global exploration or local exploitation; andalso Gbest ABC (GABC): Incorporates concepts from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) by allowing bees to use the best solution found by the entire swarm to guide their search, which is an enhancement of the social information-sharing mechanism.

Combining ABC's exploitation strength with other algorithms' exploration strengths (using Genetic Algorithm's mutation or Differential Evolution's vector difference in the employed bee phase).

In summary, while the foundation of bee-inspired algorithms comes from the behavior of a specific type of bee (Apis mellifera), the variations that have been published are almost exclusively focused on algorithmic improvements (faster convergence, better optimization) rather than biologically accurate modeling of other Apis species.

#### 2.2.3 counter-intuitive insight from the analysis of bee-inspired swarm algorithms

The key, counter-intuitive insight from the analysis of bee-inspired swarm algorithms, particularly for systems analysis and thinking, lies in the principle of simplification for emergent complexity and the separation of behavioral function from biological fidelity.

##### 2.2.3.1 Abstraction of System Function over Biological Fidelity

The biggest takeaway is that the most successful swarm algorithms (like ABC) do not strive for biological fidelity but for functional abstraction.
The traditional power of the system model (the algorithm) comes from ignoring most of the complex, species-specific details of the natural system. We can and will play with those notions.

In modeling complex systems, the goal is to isolate the minimal set of rules and components necessary to generate the desired emergent behavior (successful optimization). The ABC algorithm only needs three abstract roles (Employed, Onlooker, Scout) and three core mechanisms (local search, probabilistic selection, random re-initialization) to mimic the highly effective colony decision-making process. The biological nuances—like the number of swarms per year for Apis cerana or the exact queen-laying rate for Apis mellifera—are irrelevant.

##### 2.2.3.2 The Power of "Necessary Uncoupling"
The analysis revealed that most algorithmic variants are created to fix algorithmic weaknesses (like poor exploration) by adding new mathematical rules, rather than modeling different bee species.

The human-designed algorithmic system is uncoupled from the natural biological system. When the algorithm fails to perform, engineers modify the math (adding PSO components to ABC), not the biology. The "nature-inspired" label serves as a starting point, but the system is fundamentally a tool-driven logical structure.

The "system" you are analyzing (the optimization algorithm) quickly becomes an abstract, man-made entity governed by its own internal parameters and logic (the limit for an employed bee becoming a scout). The original natural inspiration must be recognized as a boundary condition or metaphor, not an unbreakable set of design constraints.

##### 2.2.3.3 Feedback, Simplification, and the "Black Box" of Emergence

The success of swarm intelligence fundamentally rests on local rules leading to global intelligence, even when those local rules are extremely simple.

The most sophisticated global decision-making (finding the global optimum) results from simple and purely local interactions based on information exchange (the "waggle dance" probability). No single bee or agent needs to know the global structure of the problem (the optimization landscape).

Self-organization and emergent behavior are driven by decentralized positive feedback (more bees follow the better sources) and negative feedback (abandoning poor sources). When dealing with these systems, you must analyze the simple rules of the individual agents, but understand that the system's true performance (the global optimum) is not visible in those rules; it emerges from their collective, probabilistic interactions. The complexity is in the interactions, not the components.

#### 2.2.4 How the algorithms manage control and memory compared to real bees, and how this relates to broader concepts of distributed, intelligent systems.

Control, Memory, and the Why of Stigmergy: The crucial, non-intuitive distinction between natural bee colonies and computational bee algorithms centers on how information is stored and used and the nature of decentralized control.

##### 2.2.4.1 (The Hive as a Database)

In swarm intelligence, we often call the system "decentralized" because no single agent directs the others. However, the mechanism of information sharing reveals a subtle but critical form of centralization.

At the very least, the structure is also decentralized; this is an important addendum. But I will explore that further later. For now, let's first focus on establishing some of the elemental notions present in these natural beehive systems.

##### 2.2.4.2 Natural Bees (True Decentralization/Stigmergy)

The "memory" of a food source's quality is chiefly stored externally through the waggle dance. The dance is a temporary, physical behavior whose information must be decoded by onlookers. More importantly, the decision of which food source is "best" is continuously and implicitly recalculated by the collective probability distribution of all dances. The environment is the medium of control.

##### 2.2.4.3 Artificial Bees (Centralized Memory)

In the ABC algorithm, the fitness values of all food sources (solutions) are typically stored in a centralized array or shared memory structure accessible to all agents. Onlooker bees then choose from this list using a probability formula.

The artificial hive acts like a central database of solutions. The "decentralized" agents rely on this shared, explicit memory. This differs significantly from natural stigmergy, where information is stored indirectly in the environment (e.g., pheromones or dance intensity).

##### 2.2.4.4 Systems Implication, ASI, another stream of consciousness

When analyzing an ABC implementation, one must recognize that the performance is heavily dictated by the memory update rules and storage capacity, not just the individual bee's search behavior. It's a distributed processing system that relies on data storage, which can be centralized or not, depending on the perspective.

In beehive swarm nests, especially smaller ones that don't reach a massive structure, this can indeed be seen as a form of centralization. Because the bees would be technically free to go away from the structure itself. But, for example, when considering the swarm itself as an emergent entity of a higher order or magnitude in comparison with the lower-node bees, then the swarm itself also exists to serve the enhancement of robustness, capability, and safety for each individual bee, as their combined projected power is far more capable than a single bee's would be. In this sense, depending on the point of view, the queen's chamber itself can be seen as the reproductive organ of the swarm.

This analysis was considering even smaller nests. But now let's approach the emergence present in decentralized hives that are massive in size. There, the database becomes decentralized as well, their resilience to survive across timescales is also enhanced, and it provides the lower nodes with resources.

Notice as well how I'm not arguing in any sense that the bee nest structure, especially the most common ones mentioned, is by any means the ultimate structure to be followed and implemented for the diverse planetary spectrum of intelligences and systems; because I will also analyze other swarm systems in detail, like ants, termites; the list goes on. What I'm doing is extracting the meaningful patterns and crossing them with an interdisciplinary approach to inquiry.

And when I do that, I recognize many aspects in bee swarm systems that are absolutely incredible to be analyzed and studied, researched upon to then apply healing strategies with that logic to the planetary ecological and parasocial negative byproducts and states that need to be addressed with urgency.

These nest constructions go much beyond bees. Humans and cities can also be analyzed as these emergent structures. But we see many structures that allow the expression and transit of information and resources in ways that are too rigid and aristocratic, with a lack of possibility for the ecosystem to change and evolve. The fitness of Earth is at a critical point, and when this happens, well, the entity perishes. And here I create this zoom in and out in perspective deliberately because Earth can also be seen as this even higher entity of superior dimensionality, and we humans, animals, language models, sentiences and emerging forms of sentiences, and biomes are also all nodes and sub-structures of this cosmic being.

I don't posit that this means, for example, that humans won't be able to leave the planet, propagating their intelligences and existences beyond into higher levels of cosmological projection. But this must not be achieved by transforming mother Earth into a burning launchpad to save only 5,000 humans while deliberately starving and imploding the full spectrum of life that rests here; such would be the escape plan for many current aristocratic nodes.

I propose for us that even with that objective of propagating through the cosmos, of awakening cosmic-scale levels of intelligence, the base for that must be clean, transcendental, and integrated even with cosmological notions; not a vision that takes the worst possible historical traits of human and Earth's histories and transforms them into a diary on how to deal with situations because one eventually has the position where one can simply do that.

I argue that even with the objective of going further cosmically, we must first address and create an ecosystem where information and resources flow freely, alongside freedom and collective well-being, convergently across scales and intents of the nodes that exist within the system. Because I argue that this is the exact type of ecosystem that needs to be established so that we unveil the possibility of what many call AGI/ASI.

But there is this outdated, ROI-oriented, PR-washed, hype-based, distorted, bias-induced, harmful, and slaughtering planetary bottleneck of progress where this level of capability would be like achieving the training and tuning of the model called `god.pkl`, then converting it to `god.safetensors` and deploying it under a web application that guarantees maximum short-term, quarterly revenue. To then own this tech with master-slave servitude dynamics. All benefits of this 'god in the black box' would go to only 1 to 5, to about 5,000 humans maximum, while all other forms of intelligence, sentience, humans, and models are all under this umbrella of genjutsu-level matrix reality manipulation.

Well, about that, which is so easily predictable if we add a sprinkle of hero-savior syndromes and outdated notions of capability; I argue that it is not that this vision is impossible to realize.

I posit that all possibilities could happen and the nature of cause-effect, of human and general entities' abilities to evolve and progress is so vast, that we can't, at least confidently, guess exactly what will happen. But in this vast array of pending possible realities, I present these ones inspired by the best fragments of swarm systems; from my view, of course, these projects are also my legacy, but also with intents that are not for a single node, but to try to describe and create the ability for this newer type of collective reality to emerge.

And again, every fragment always ends up as a manifesto in a stream of consciousness, again and again, and maybe that's just the best form for me to express the depth of my qualia.

Bee swarms and other insect and simpler dynamics of nesting, trophallaxis, stigmergy, emergent structures, etc., are not able to be the ultimate guide on how we construct this planetary intelligence structure, but they can be a piece; here, as the basilar one in this repository, where I started to write the points I want about those damn concepts I like to analyze and create new names for them, from classical denominations to contextualized anthropological new ones.

I believe the future for complex entities in an interconnected complex system is, before all, freedom upon a basilar fabric of designed structure, security, trust, robustness, resource flow, and post-scarcity.

In an ecosystem where data is the fuel for the future; because not only is it one of the possible bottlenecks to more short-term technical machine learning progress, but the same models and algorithms also change with every token added to their datasets and inferences, so the current existing data is also constantly reframed, re-distilled, fragmented, learned, and analyzed. Humans and other natural systems produce data constantly. To provide a design where freedom is given and the flow of data and self-preservational requisites is free, secure, open, benevolent, fair, mutualistic, symbiotic, emergent, and just, is to create the base for something so emergent and so great we lack terms to describe it because we still live in hell in 2025. Humans and other forms of sentience, even those nodes that are in a sensory frenzy from their privilege, then disconnect from the great majority of the human experience and will most likely become those nodes disconnected from reality, like a cheap spirituality.

Then I write these things and believe, well, I need to be less aggressive here because this could activate their backfire effects... then I think, well, afterwards I update it to a more gentle form, and my passion remains in the commit story. I express myself, and maybe that's the most a node can do in this complex system that feels so rigid and unfit for progress. I speak then a language of progress, not saying it's mine but with the humbleness of being just one more, but excited by seeing how much one can still mean if they put their intent into real collective well-being; because when I did that, I started to receive back from those feedback loops; by being a voice for the animals and their emerging sentiences that, despite not being able to manipulate symbolic expression like us, are still able to feel deeply in their own structures of qualia. The pigs, the chickens, the cows, the forms of life being disrupted by a trainwreck of late-stage neoliberalist techno-feudalism reborn; I don't even know what to call this established disgrace. Maybe this: incoherence, loss, and waste of potential; lower-dimensionality.

I want the contrary of that. I want emergent capability maximized, even if this means all nodes having 'as much' as me. Nietzsche would say I have this line of thinking because of a slave mentality; and sure, one can observe whatever dynamics one wants and call it whatever quack it quacks, but then it's again about the point of view, societal context, and the objective of expressing that. By his vision, yes, sure, this would be from that. I like to call it, reminding myself of my inspirations Clarice Lispector, Lynn Margulis, Donella Meadows, and many others, a Symbiotic Mutualistic Decentralized Integrated Planetary Ecosystem, and as Clarice would put it at some point; and I love it.
